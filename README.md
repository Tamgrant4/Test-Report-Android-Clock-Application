# Test-Report-Android-Clock-Application
Android Clock App Basic Test This document outlines a basic test plan and test cases for the standard Android Clock application. ## Approach The testing focused on verifying the core functionalities (World Clock, Alarm, Timer, Stopwatch), basic UI/UX elements (layout consistency), and a key performance aspect (alarm triggering reliability). The tests were designed to be executed manually on a Emulator (Android medium phone API 35) using only standard phone tools and observation. The test plan defines the scope, objectives, tools, and testing environment. Five test cases were developed to cover functional navigation, alarm functionality, stopwatch operation, and basic UI consistency. The results of the test execution are documented in the "Test Report: Android Clock Application.docx"
